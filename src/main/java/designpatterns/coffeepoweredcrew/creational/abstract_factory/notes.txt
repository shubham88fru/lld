- When we have two or more object which work together forming a kit or set and there can be
multiple sets or kits that can be created by client code.
 - Intent behind this pattern is to separate client code from concrete objects forming
  such a set and also from the code which creates these sets.

- Think the pizza builder example from christopher okhravi's class. A set of pizza toppings
only go with a particular type of pizza, but with every type of pizza.

- Implementation:
    1. We start by studying the product sets.
        i) Create abstract factory as an abstract class or an interface.
        ii) Abstract factory defines abstract methods for creating products.
        ii) Provide concrete implementation of factory for each set or products.
    2. Abstract factory makes use of factory method pattern. Think of abstract factory as
    an object with multiple factory methods.
