- We need to provide a placeholder or surrogate to another object.
- Proxy acts on behalf of the object and is used for lots of reasons some of the main reasons are:
    1. Protection Proxy - Control access to original object's operations.
    2. Remote Proxy - Provides a local representation of a remote object.
    3. Virtual Proxy - Delays construction of original object until absolutely necessary.
- Client is unaware of existence of proxy.Proxy performs its work transparently.
- Lazy loading of collections by hibernate, APO based method level security, RMI/Web service stubs are
examples of real life proxy usage.
- Two types - Static proxy and dynamic proxy.
- Dynamic proxies are created during runtime (by implementing the InvocationHandler interface.)
