- We have an existing object which provides the functionality that client needs. But client code can't
use this object because it expects an object with different interface.
- Using adapter design pattern we make this existing object work with client by adapting the object
to client's expected interface.
- This pattern is also called as wrapper as it "wraps" existing object.
- Two types: Object adapter (uses composition over inheritance) and Class Adapter.
