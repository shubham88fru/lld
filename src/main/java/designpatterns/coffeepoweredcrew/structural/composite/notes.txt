- We have a part-whole relationship or hierarchy of objects and we want to be able to treat all
objects in this hierarchy uniformly.
- This is NOT a simple composition concept from object oriented programming but a further
enhancement to that principle.
- Think of composite patten when dealing with tree structure of objects.
- Composite pattern allows us to treat all objects, whether they are using composition (composite)
or not (leaf) in the same way. Without composite pattern client code will have to write
code differently to handle object which has children. Composite pattern allows
client to call a method on object and pattern takes care of handling children if present.
