- Our system needs a large number of objects of a particular class and maintaining these
instances is a performance concern.
- Flyweight allows us to share an object in multiple contexts. But instead of sharing entire object,
which may not be feasible, we divide the object state in two parts: intrinsic (state that is shared in
every context) & extrinsic state (context specific state). We create objects with only intrinsic state
and share them in multiple contexts.
- Client or user of object provides the extrinsic state to object to carry out its functionality.
- We provide a factory so client can get required flyweight objects based on some key to identify flyweight.
