- Our implementations and abstractions are generally coupled to each other in normal inheritance.
- Using bridge pattern we can decouple them, so they can both change without affecting each other.
- We achieve this feat by creating two separate inheritance hierarchies; one for implementation and
another for abstraction.
- We use composition to bridge these two hierarchies.
