- Using observer design pattern we can notify multiple objects whenever an object
changes state.
- This design pattern is also called as publisher-subscriber or pub-sub.
- We are defining one-to-many dependency between objects, where many objects are listening
for state change of a single object, without tightly coupling all of them together.
- This pattern is often implemented where listener only gets notification that "something" has
changed in the object's state. Listeners query back to find out more information if needed.
This makes it more generic as different listeners may be interested in different states.
