- We want to represent a request or a method call as an object. Information about parameters passed
and the actual operations is encapsulated in a object called command.
- Advantage of command pattern is that, what would have been a method call is now an object which can be
stored for later execution or sent to other parts of code.
- commands typically invoke the actual operations on a receiver but contain parameters or info needed
invocation.
- client is responsible for creating instances of command and providing it with receiver and request
information.
- Commands can also implement an undo feature. Here command itself stores a snapshot of receiver.
- We can now even queue our command objects and execute them later.
