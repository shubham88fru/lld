- Mediator encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other. Due to this encapsulation there is a
loose coupling between the interacting objects.
- Typically an object explicitly knows about another object to which it wants to interact i.e. to call a method.
In mediator pattern this interaction is within the mediator object and interacting objects nly know about
the mediator object.
- Benefit of this arrangement is that the interaction can now change without needing modifications to participating
objects. Changing the mediator allows to add/remove participants in an interaction.
