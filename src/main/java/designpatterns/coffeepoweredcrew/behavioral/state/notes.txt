- State design pattern allows our objects to behave differently based on its current internal state.
- This pattern allows to define the state specific behaviors in separate classes.
- Operations defined in the class delegate to the current state object's implementation of that behavior.
- State transitions can be triggerred by states themselves in which case each state knows about at least one other
state's existence.
