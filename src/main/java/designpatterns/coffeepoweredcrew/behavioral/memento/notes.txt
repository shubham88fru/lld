- When we want to store object's state without exposing internal details about the state when we can use
memento design pattern.
- We can use memento design pattern to take a snapshot of object's state which can be then used to restore
object to that particular state.
- The main intent behind saving state is often because we want to restore the object to a saved state.
- Using memento we can ask an object to give its state as a single, "sealed" object and store it for later use.
This object should not expose the state for modification.
- originator provides a method to get a memento out of it. And another method to assign it a memento,
which results in getting the originator's state reset to the one in memento.
- This pattern is often combined with command design pattern to provide the undo functionality in application.
