- We use interpreter when we want to process a simple "language" with rules or grammar.
 E.g. File access requires user role and admin role.
- Interpreter allows us to represent the rules of language or grammar in a data structure and then
interpret sentences in that language.
- Each class in this pattern represents a rule in the language. Classes also provide a method
to interpret an expression.
